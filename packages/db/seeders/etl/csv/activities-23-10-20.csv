Due to COVID-19 their call centre in the Philippines was forced to temporarily switch off the phone lines for Customer Care. Netregistry quickly skilled up its sales team in Australia to provide support via live chat and began arranging laptops and internet connectivity for team members in the Philippines so they could do the same. Netregistry then switched off its sales phone lines too and turned on sales chat in its place. This allowed the company to focus on supporting customers via chat and support cases in Service Cloud while working to get the Customer Care team back online completely. The team worked hard to reduce abandoned chats, resulting in a decrease from over 15% in early April to less than 2% by mid-June.",ANZ,04/08/2020,04/08/2022,https://www.salesforce.com/au/customer-success-stories/Netregistry/,Rachel Thompson,ESMB - Future of Work in Small Business
